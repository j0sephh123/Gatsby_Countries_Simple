# WP thoughts 

## 1. My knowledge of how wp is used

## 2. My learning experience.

## 3. What do you need for wp
*Two Things*
Server + MySQL - XAMPP or equivalent
code - local, ftp, github
There is a config.php file where it access the db and that's basically it

*What is a php file*

*Directory Structure*
`wp-admin & wp-includes` are overwritten by every new wordpress release.

You work in `wp-content`. There are 3 folders there:
`uploads` - images
[example](http://chromeye.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/carousel_se.jpg)

`plugins` - they looks scarier than they actually are, you need a 
- directory and `index.php`, 
- example to dynamically create a post in wp instead of using the admin panel

```php
foreach($ourApiData as $item) {
  // the idea here is to get prepared data from api and insert it in wp 
  $newPostID = wp_insert_post([
    "post_type" => "race",
    "post_title" => $item["name"], 
    "post_status" => "publish", // draft...
  ]); 
  update_post("race_property_72", $item["new_value_of_the_property"], $newPostID); // update custom field
}
```
  
`themes` - list of themes. WP has default ones, you can look at them. Will this help you learn more - probably not. For me it was demotivating.

## 4. How does a wordpress database structure look?
Meta is like the information about that post/user/comment.
- `wp_links` - deprecated afaik
- `wp_options` 
- `wp_posts`  
- `wp_terms`  
- `wp_termmeta` 
- `wp_term_relationships` 
- `wp_term_taxonomy` 
- `wp_users` 
- `wp_usermeta` 
- `wp_comments`
- `wp_commentmeta` 

## 5. Simple example for problems generated by plugins

```php
function getAPIStuff() {
  $ourData = $_POST['raceID'];
  $ourOtherData = $_POST['otherthing'];

  $resp = functionThatFetchesData($ourData, $ourOtherData);
  
  echo json_encode($resp["data"]);
  die();
}
add_action('wp_ajax_getAPIStuff', 'getAPIStuff');
add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_getAPIStuff', 'getAPIStuff');
```

# 6. Customizing it example.

# 7. Good thing about acquiring WP knowledge

# 8. More examples of things we could do in WP that we didn't have the knowledge/time at that moment - some easier than others.

## 9. Would I be willing to continue working on wp 

# 10. Gatsby stuff

### 11. Probably the main question about Gatsby is are we going to be able to do the same that we did in WP

### Why bother writing all of that - there is actually no need to. Because a person learns the most about a thing when he tries to explain it to others.
